Since my pre-university days, a profound fascination with mathematics, particularly in topology and geometry, has driven my intellectual pursuits. The spark was ignited by explorations into topics like cosmology based on the theory of relativity, black holes, quantum mechanics, and the intrinsic characteristics of familiar shapes. Initially drawn towards physics for its study of geometric models of the universe rooted in differential geometry and topology, I heeded advice from seniors and professors. Consequently, I pursued a major in mathematics with the ambition of delving deeply into the realms of differential geometry and topology.

Actively engaging in conferences related to geometric analysis became a cornerstone of my academic journey. Notable events include the Einstein & Harmonic Manifold conference and the Minimal Surface School, where discussions with experts like Professor Kyeongsu Choi and exchanges on the Penrose Inequality with Richard Schoen enriched my understanding. Participation in a conference organized by the Korean Mathematical Society provided the chance to discuss visualizing minimal surfaces with Professor Seong-Deog Yang and discrete differential geometry with Professor Joseph Cho.

In the realm of topology, my focus leaned towards practical applications. I enrolled in courses on Algebraic Topology and Low-dimensional Topology, delving into topics such as the Jones Polynomial and Khovanov Homology for computing and classifying knots. Currently, I collaborate with Professor Seungwon Kim, utilizing Fox Calculus to compute knots on differentiable manifolds.

Motivated by a keen interest in geometry and topology, I sought advanced courses beyond the usual undergraduate curriculum. These included courses on Sobolev spaces in PDE, Low-dimensional Topology & Knot theory, Riemannian geometry, and Geometric PDE covering curve shortening flow and mean curvature flow.

The Undergraduate Research Program provided an avenue to explore topics not covered in standard undergraduate studies. Despite the absence of courses on smooth manifolds and knot theory, I collaborated with professors to study "Geometry of Differential Forms" and "Introduction to Smooth Manifold," creating comprehensive lecture notes for the latter. Additionally, I explored topics in "Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity" relevant to topological quantum field theory.

While my primary focus has been on theoretical aspects, I developed a slight interest in numerical PDE. After completing a course on the Finite Difference Method (FDM), I applied it to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for my final project. This project led to presentations at Ajou University and inspired attempts to implement numerical approximations for the Curve Shortening Flow using FDM.

The onset of COVID-19 significantly transformed my student life. Transitioning from exclusively offline classes to adapting to online learning proved challenging initially. This experience served as a catalyst for a temporary leave of absence, during which I explored non-academic experiences.

The most significant gain during my hiatus was the development of teaching skills. Serving as a homeroom teacher for approximately 70 high school students preparing for university entrance exams, I adopted a flipped learning approach due to COVID-19 restrictions. Despite the challenges, this unconventional teaching method sparked interest among students, leading to commendable scores on their respective school exams. Additionally, I taught college-level subjects such as Calculus, Ordinary Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and Engineering Mathematics, emphasizing the organic connection between calculus and linear algebra.

The hiatus, though not without challenges, provided opportunities for personal and academic growth. Despite facing difficulties in balancing teaching responsibilities and personal studies, I dedicated time to supplementing my knowledge in Abstract Algebra 1 and Numerical Analysis. For Numerical Analysis, I conducted additional study sessions and prepared resources, leading to an interview request for an exemplary student-led class.

Currently serving as the president of the mathematics academic club, MIMIC, at SKKU, I oversee individual presentations, tutoring, and volunteer activities. Managing the club's YouTube channel and website, I have given four presentations, covering topics from non-Euclidean parallel postulate to the Curve Shortening Flow.

Throughout my undergraduate journey, I received numerous scholarships, including the department's academic excellence scholarship, the university's president's scholarship, and scholarships from the Korea Ministry of Science and ICT. In 2021, I secured second place and received a silver award at the University Students Contest of Mathematics organized by the Korean Mathematical Society.

These diverse experiences have profoundly shaped my academic journey, fueling my passion for mathematics and teaching while equipping me with a comprehensive skill set and a profound understanding of mathematical concepts.
