# Abstract
A cornerstone of the Brunn-Minkowski theory is the Minkowski problem initiated by Minkowski himself over a century ago. This problem characterizes measures generated by convex bodies and has been generalized to the $L_{p}$-Minkowski problem. In recent years, much of the interest in the $L_{p}$-Minkowski problem has migrated to the study of regular solutions. In this talk, we discuss recent developments in this field, focusing on the regularity of convex bodies. This talk is based on joint work with Kyeongsu Choi and Minhyun Kim.
