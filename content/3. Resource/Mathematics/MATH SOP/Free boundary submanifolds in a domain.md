# Abstract
We discuss two properties of free boundary submanifolds in a domain. One is a ==rigidity== result about free boundary cmc-H surfaces in a convex domain of a space form. The other is a linear isoperimetric inequality for free boundary submanifolds in a geodesic ball of a Riemannian manifold in terms of mean curvature and the distance function
