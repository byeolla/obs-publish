# Abstract
In this talk, we study rigidity for weighted area-minimizing hypersurface. First, we review previous rigidity results related to scalar curvature. In particular, we focus on the splitting results for area-minimizing hypersurface. Second, we consider Weighted manifold and introduce our rigidity results of weighted aresa-minimizing hypersurface.
