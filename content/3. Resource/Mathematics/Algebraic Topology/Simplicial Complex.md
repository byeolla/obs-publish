## Properties
1. Simplicial Complex is path connected.
> [!proof-] proof 
A simplicial complex is locally path-connected.
A simplicial complex is [[Locally Homeomorphism|locally homeomorphic]] to $R^k \times \left[0,\infty\right)^{n-k}$.
A connected and [[Locally path-connected]] space is path-connected.
When a space is locally connected, the path components are open. So if C𝐶 is a path component, it's open, and its complement is a union of other path components, which are open so C𝐶 is closed too.
