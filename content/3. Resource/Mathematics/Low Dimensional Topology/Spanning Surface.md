A spanning surface for a link $L$ is a surface $F \subset S^{3}$ with boundary equal to $L$.
%% such that $S \cap \partial N(L)$ consists of one $(p, 1)$-curve on each component of $\partial N(L)$, where $p$ refers to the number of meridians. We will not distinguish between the spanning surface $S$ as a subset of $S^3$ and the spanning surface as a subset of $S^3 \setminus N(L)$, calling both $S$. Two spanning surfaces for $L$ are considered equivalent if one is ambient isotopic to the other in $S^3\setminus N(L)$. We will assume that $S$ contains no closed components, so that every point in $S$ is connected to $L$ by a path in $S$. %%
