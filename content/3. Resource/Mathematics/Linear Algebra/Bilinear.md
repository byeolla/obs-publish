# Bilinear 
**Definition**. *Bilinear*
If $V, W, \text{and} \ Z$ are vector spaces, a map $B: V \times W \to Z$ is said to be ***bilinear*** if it is linear in each variable sparately when
$$\begin{align}
B(a_{1}v_{1} + a_{2}v_{2}, w) = a_{1}B(v_{1}, w) + a_{2}B(v_{2}, w)\\
B(v, a_{1}w_{1} + a_{2}w_{2}) = a_{1}B(v, w_{1}) + a_{2}B(v, w_{2})
\end{align}$$

# Algebra over $\mathbb{R}$
**Definition.** *Algebra*
An **algebra** is a real vector space $V$ endowed with a bilinear product map $V \times V \to V$

## Remark
The algebra is said to be ***commutative*** or ***associative*** if the bilinear product has that property.
