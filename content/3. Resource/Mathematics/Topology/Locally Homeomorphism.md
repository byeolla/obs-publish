A topological space $X$ is **locally homeomorphic** to $Y$ if every point of $𝑋$ has a neighborhood that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to an open subset of $𝑌$. 

# Fomral Definition
A function $f : X \to Y$ between two topological spaces is called a local homeomorphism if every point $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood $U$ whose image $f\left(U\right)$ is open in $Y$ and the restriction $f|_{U} : U \to f\left(U\right)$ is a homeomorphism(with subspace topology).
## Example
For example, a [[Manifold]] of dimension $n$ is locally homeomorphic to $R^{n}$.

## Property
If there is a local homeomorphism from $X$ to $Y$, then $X$ is locally homeomorphic to $Y$, but the converse is not always true. For example, $S^{2}$, being a manifold, is locally homeomorphic to the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, but there is no local homeomorphism $S^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$.
