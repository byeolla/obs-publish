I agree with the idea the advent of the computer has made people's live better. 

  

First of all, I can get a lot of information easily BY using computer. 

  

For example, before the computers advent, I had to go library to get my resources FOR my research.

  

But, nowadays, I can get easily by just one clicks.

  

Also, I can communicate with other others using computers.

  

What I mean is that, I can contact to professorS who are not in my university.

  

For these reasons, the advent of computer has made people's live better.
