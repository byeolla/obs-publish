According to the reading, environmental disturbance is a temporary condition that causes a significance change in an ecosystems.

  

  

  

The professor describes two examples to explain this.

  

  

  

First of all, the professor talks about the natural fire cyle.

  

  

  

He says that the large tree MAKES CANOPY AND absorbs the sunlight , so the small plants can not get enough sunlight.

  

  

  

However, fire cylcle provides AN opportunities FOR small plant to get enough sun light.

  

  

  

Also, the professor talks about the exotic species.

  

  

  

He says that, for example, sky beetle invaded natural range.

  

  

  

And it is very harmful because IT makeS a hole in the tree.

  

  

  

And it'S damaging SO IT CAN potentially DEVESTATE the natural RANGE.
