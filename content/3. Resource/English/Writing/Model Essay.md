[[Brainstorming]]
``` #busy 
To begin with, people today spend more time on their duties than ever before. This is because people spend most of their time at their officies, and smartphones and internet access force people to continue working even when people are at home. For example, my sister Katie works for a large investment banking firm. She is supposed to work from nine to six, but she actually works from eight to ten every day. She told me that she feels obligated to serve her company and to earn income for her household. Most her colleagues feel the same, so they contact each other by phone and the internet even during the weekends so that they can finish their work faster. Since everyone else at the company try their best to achieve their goals, my sister also makes every effort to fulfuill herobligations even when she is not at work. For this reason, I strongly believe that modern people spend more time doing what they have to do, not for their personal enjoyment.
