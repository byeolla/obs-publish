>For instance, in 2005, the Korean government announced that they will increase the support on B. After the initial announcement, a group of Korean citizens ==staged a rally to protest against== the government's decision. The protesters urged the administration to withdraw such demand claiming that governemtn funding on B should be the last thing to consider.

>For example, I started using an AI assistant at work last year. ==Ever since/Once== I started using this technology, my life totally changed. It not only facilitated my work but also  saved more time for personal enjoyment. With the AI managing my schedule, I was able to visit the gym, attend regular medical checkups, and even drop off my dogs at a friend's house. These were tasks that I could never have accomplished without the support of technological advancement. This trend will continue to grow, and I believe people will gain even more time in the future.

>#### 행복

I was feeling stressed and overwhelmed at school(work) because I had too much homework(workload) to finish in a short period of time. I felt burned out and lost interest in my mundane day-to-day tasks. However, everything changed when I started 주제활동. 주제활동 helped me clear my mind and provided a much-needed break from the stressful schoolwork.

>#### 광고
>Many people argue that obesity is caused by individual choices. However, I strongly believe that we should blame fast-food advertisements. This is because people often make decisions based on advertising. Fast-food companies frequently glamorize their products, presenting them as highly appealing and convenient. Consequently, these advertisements attract new customers and encourage them to consume high-calorie foods more frequently. For example, many fast-food companies showcase mouth-watering visuals in TV commercials. People watching this advertisement buy the products to satisfy their appetites. In fact, studies have shown that exposure to such advertising can influence food preferences, especially among children, leading to weight gain and obesity.
## 맺음말(생략 가능)
Overall = To sum up

```
[도입]I understand why Brad whinks that supporting the arts is fundamental to the enrichment of our society. [나의 의견]However, in my opinion, the government should invest funds in renewable energy sources instead of art programs. [이유]This is mainly because renewable energy projects often call for significant public investment to get started. [일반적 진술]As the initial costs can be high, private investors may be hesitant to take on the risks associated with developing new technologies. [예시]For example, the transition to renewable energy sources requires the development of new infrastructure, such as wind farms, solar panels, and energy storage facilities. Building this infrastructure can be costly, and only the government can provide funding for infrastructure development. [맺음말]Overall, investment in renewable energy sources by the government can serve as a cornerstone that drives activites in the private sector.
